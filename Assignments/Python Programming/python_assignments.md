Write Python script for the following tasks -  

1. The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
Example


Print the following:

8
-2
15

Sample Input 0

3
2
Sample Output 0

5
1
6

2. Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

3
Sample Output 0

Weird
Explanation 0


 is odd and odd numbers are weird, so print Weird.

Sample Input 1

24
Sample Output 1

Not Weird
Explanation 1

 n= 24
 n>20 and n is even, so it is not weird.

 3. Task

Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

Input Format

Read , the year to test.

Constraints

1900 < year < 100000

Output Format

The function must return a Boolean value (True/False). Output is handled by the provided code stub.

Sample Input 0

1990
Sample Output 0

False
Explanation 0

1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap year.

4. Write a program in Python to calculate fibonacci series upto 3000. 
5. Write a program in Python check whether a given input string is palindrome or not.
