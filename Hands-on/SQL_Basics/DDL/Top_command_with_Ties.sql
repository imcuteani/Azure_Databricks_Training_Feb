-- SQL Server Top Command with Ties option -- 

-- WITH Ties allows you to return more rows with values that match the last row in the 
--limited result set. WITH TIES may cause more rows to be returned than you specified in the 
-- expression

-- for e.g. if you want to return the most expensive products, then you can use 
-- top 1. However, if two or more products have the same prices as the most expensive product, 
-- then you miss the other most expensive products in the result set.
